            "content": "def divide_numbers_a(a, b): try: return a / b except ZeroDivisionError: print(&quot;Bad stuff happened!&quot;) finally: return None . On one hand, the return statement should make the function exit early when no errors are encoutered, but on the other hand, the code in the finally-clause should always run. . If the function indeed returns within the try-block, and the except and finally-block is only executed when an exception happens, the code could as well look like this: . def divide_numbers_b(a, b): try: return a / b except ZeroDivisionError: print(&quot;Bad stuff happened!&quot;) return None . Let&#39;s try and see what happens! . print(f&#39;{divide_numbers_a(1, 1)=}&#39;, end=&#39; n&#39;*2) print(f&#39;{divide_numbers_a(1, 0)=}&#39;, end=&#39; n&#39;*2) print(f&#39;{divide_numbers_b(1, 1)=}&#39;, end=&#39; n&#39;*2) print(f&#39;{divide_numbers_b(1, 0)=}&#39;, end=&#39; n&#39;*2) . divide_numbers_a(1, 1)=None Bad stuff happened! divide_numbers_a(1, 0)=None divide_numbers_b(1, 1)=1.0 Bad stuff happened! divide_numbers_b(1, 0)=None . So apparently finally trumps the return-statement in the try-block… which I guess makes sense, because why else would the finally be part of Python, if it&#39;s not always the final block being executed? .",
