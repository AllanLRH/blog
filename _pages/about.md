This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

I spend the my workdays in a week doing Data Science at [Nuuday](https://nuuday.com/), and usually some of my weekend tinkering with Data Science related stuff as well â€” especially now that the Covid-19 pandemic imposes the social distancing measures.

Hope you'll follow along on my blog, and fee free to reach out to me if you'd like to get in contact!
